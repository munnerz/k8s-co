Introducing k8s.co, a collaborative blog about Kubernetes, containers, and
anything that may be of interest to it's contributors.

## Why did this happen?

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A while ago I bought the <a href="https://t.co/05meByYEYA">https://t.co/05meByYEYA</a> domain name - I&#39;m still not sure what to do with it... any ideas? ðŸ¤”</p>&mdash; James Munnelly (@JamesMunnelly) <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesMunnelly/status/882266944484724736">July 4, 2017</a></blockquote>

I've owned the k8s.co domain name since October 2016 - I was looking for short
domains for a cluster I was setting up, and spotted it was available. I've
since used it for demos, and had a number of comments about it.

I tweeted to see what everyone else thought I should do with it, and
[@briggsl](https://twitter.com/briggsl) suggested a collaborative blog that
anybody could contribute to!

## Getting involved

I've set this up to be hosted on GitHub pages - anybody can contribute, and I'd
like to quickly establish a code of conduct and appoint others to review and
merge posts. Please check out the site on [GitHub](https://github.com/munnerz/k8s-co),
all contributions are welcome - no matter how big or small!
